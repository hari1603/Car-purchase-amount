# Car-purchase-amount

Regression analysis is performed to predict the car purchase amount. This project was done at the initial stages of learning wherein, I got to know how to execute a complete machine learning lifecycle.

It consists of the following parts:-

1. EDA (Exploratory data analysis) wherein missing values were dealt with.
2. Feature engineering involved scaling of features.
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Selection: Multiple Linear Regression and ANN was developed
